# Device Typing Cleanup

Category
- Typing refinements across device implementations and base device classes.

Method
- Align device method signatures with usage.
- Narrow optional values and eliminate unsafe casts.

Examples
- `main-ui/devices/abstract_device.py`: base device interface typing.
- `main-ui/devices/miyoo/miyoo_device.py`: concrete device implementation typing.
